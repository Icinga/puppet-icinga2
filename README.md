## Overview

Icinga2 is a widely used open source monitoring software. This Puppet module helps installing and managing configuration
of Icinga2 on multiple operating sytems.

>> This Module is a rewrite of [puppet-icinga2] and will replace it in the future.

## Module Description
This module installs and configures Icinga2 on your Linux or Windows hosts. By default it will use packages provided by
your distributions repository, respectively chocolatey on Windows. The module can be enabled to use [packages.icinga.org]
as primary repository, which will give you the ability to install the latest Icinga2 release. All features and objects
available in Icinga2 can be enabled and configured with this module.

## Setup

### What the Icinga2 Puppet module affects

* Packages Installation
* Service
* Objects Configuration
* Feature Configuration
* Apply Rules
* MySQL/PostgreSQL Database Schema Import
* Repository Management
* Certification Authority

### Dependencies
This module depends on:

* [puppetlabs/stdlib]
* [puppetlabs/concat]

Depending on your setup following modules may also be required:

* [puppetlabs/apt]
* [puppetlabs/chocolatey]

## Usage

### Installing Icinga2
The default class `icinga2` will install and configure a basic installation of Icinga2 on your system. By default it will
enable the features `checker`, `mainlog` and `notification`. As default installation source the distributions repository will
used. On Windows systems we use chocolatey. To get the latest version of Icinga2 you need to enable the `manage_repo`
parameter, which will allow the module to add the official [packages.icinga.org] repository to your host.

``` puppet
  class { 'icinga2':
    manage_repo => true
  }
```

### Enable Features
Each Icinga2 feature can be enabled or disabled by using the according classes. In addition to that, there is a set of
default features that are enabled by default: `[ 'checker', 'mainlog', 'notification' ]`

The default set of features can be changed by setting the `features` parameter:
``` puppet
class { 'icinga2':
  manage_repo => true,
  features    => ['checker', 'mainlog', 'command']
}
```

To add enable features and change their default settings, use the feature classes:
``` puppet
class { 'icinga2::feature::graphite':
  host                   => '10.10.0.15',
  port                   => 2003,
  enable_send_thresholds => true,
  enable_send_metadata   => true
}
```

### Enable IDO
The IDO feature can be enabled either in combination with MySQL or PostgreSQL. Depending on your database you need to
enable the feature `icinga2::feature::idomysql` or `icinga2::feature::idopgsql`. Both features are capable of importing
the base schema into the database, however this is disabled by default. Updating the database schema to another version
is currently not supported.


The IDO featues require an existing database and a user with permissions. When using MySQL we recommend the
[puppetlabs/mysql] Puppet module to install the database server, creat a database and manage user permissions. Here's an
example how you create a MySQL database with the corresponding user with permissions by usng the [puppetlabs/mysql]
module:

``` puppet
include icinga2
include mysql::server

mysql::db { 'icinga2':
  user     => 'icinga2',
  password => 'supersecret',
  host     => 'localhost',
  grant    => ['SELECT', 'INSERT', 'UPDATE', 'DELETE', 'DROP', 'CREATE VIEW', 'INDEX', 'EXECUTE'],
}

class{ 'icinga2::feature::idomysql':
  user          => "icinga2",
  password      => "supersecret",
  database      => "icinga2",
  import_schema => true,
  require       => Mysql::Db['icinga2']
}
```
For PostgreSQL we recomment the [puppetlabs/puppetlabs-postgresql] module. You can install the server, create databases
and manage user permissions with the module. Here's an example on how to use it in combination with Icinga2:

``` puppet
include icinga2
include postgresql::server

postgresql::server::db { 'icinga2':
  user     => 'icinga2',
  password => postgresql_password('icinga2', 'supersecret'),
}

class{ 'icinga2::feature::idopgsql':
  user          => "icinga2",
  password      => "supersecret",
  database      => "icinga2",
  import_schema => true,
  require       => Postgresql::Server::Db['icinga2']
}
```

### Clustering Icinga 2
Icinga 2 can run in three different roles:

* A master node which is on top of the hierarchy.
* A satellite node which is a child of a satellite or master node.
* A client node which works as an agent connected to master and/or satellite nodes.

To learn more about Icinga 2 Clustering, follow the official docs on [distributed monitoring]. The following examples show
how a these roles can be configured using this Puppet module.

#### Master
A Master node has no parent and is usually also the place where you enable the IDO and notification features. A Master
sends configurations over the Icinga 2 protocol to Satellites and/or Clients.

More detailed examples can be found in the [examples] directory.

Ths examples creates the coniguration for a Master that has one Satellite connected. A global zone is created for
templates and all features of a typical master are enabled.

``` puppet
  class { 'icinga2':
    confd     => false,
    features  => ['checker','mainlog','notification','statusdata','compatlog','command'],
    constants => {
      'ZoneName' => 'master',
    },
  }

  class { 'icinga2::feature::api':
    accept_commands => true,
    endpoints       => {
      'master.example.org' => {},
      'satellite.example.org' => {
        'host' => '172.16.2.11'
      }
    },
    zones           => {
      'master' => {
        'endpoints' => ['master.example.org'],
      },
      'dmz'    => {
        'endpoints' => ['satellite.example.org'],
        'parent'    => 'master',
      },
    }
  }

  icinga2::object::zone { 'global-templates':
    global => true,
  }
```

#### Satellite
A Satellite has a parent node and one or multiple child nodes. Satallites are usually created to distribute the
monitoring load or to reach delimited zones in the network. A Satellite either executes checks itself or delegates them
to a client.

The Satellite has less features enabled but the same zones as the Master. It is connected to the Master and the Client.
The Master is the parent of the Satellite.

``` puppet
  class { 'icinga2':
    confd     => false,
    features  => ['checker','mainlog'],
    constants => {
      'ZoneName' => 'dmz',
    },
  }

  class { 'icinga2::feature::api':
    accept_config   => true,
    accept_commands => true,
    endpoints       => {
      'satellite.example.org' => {},
      'master.example.org' => {
        'host' => '172.16.1.11',
      },
    },
    zones           => {
      'master' => {
        'endpoints' => ['master.example.org'],
      },
      'dmz' => {
        'endpoints' => ['satellite.example.org'],
        'parent'    => 'master',
      },
    }
  }

  icinga2::object::zone { 'global-templates':
    global => true,
  }
```

#### Client
Icinga 2 runs as a client usually on each of your servers. It receives config or commands from a Satellite or Master node
and runs the checks that must be executed locally.

The Client is connected to the Satellite. The Satellite is the parent of the Client.

``` puppet
  class { 'icinga2':
    confd     => false,
    features  => ['checker','mainlog'],
  }

  class { 'icinga2::feature::api':
    pki             => 'none',
    accept_config   => true,
    accept_commands => true,
    endpoints       => {
      'NodeName' => {},
      'satellite.example.org' => {
        'host' => '172.16.2.11',
      }
    },
    zones           => {
      'ZoneName' => {
        'endpoints' => ['NodeName'],
        'parent' => 'dmz',
      },
      'dmz' => {
        'endpoints' => ['satellite.example.org'],
      }
    }
  }

  icinga2::object::zone { 'global-templates':
    global => true,
  }
```

### Custom configuration files
Sometimes it's necessary to cover very special configurations that you cannot handle with this module. In this case you
can use the `icinga2::config::file` tag on your file ressource. This module collects all file ressource types with this
tag and triggers a reload of Icinga2 on a file change.

``` puppet
  include icinga2
  file { '/etc/icinga2/conf.d/for-loop.conf':
    ensure => file,
    tag    => 'icinga2::config::file',
  }
```

### Public Classes

#### Class: `icinga2`
The default class of this modoule. It handles the basic installation and configuration of Icinga2. When you declare this
class, puppet will do the following:

* Install Icinga2
* Place a default configuration for the Icinga2 daemon
* Keep the default configuration of the Icinga2 package
* Start Icinga2 and enable the service

This class can be declared without adjusting any parameter:

``` puppet
class { 'icinga2': }
```

**Parameters within `icinga2`:**

##### `ensure`
Defines if the service should be `running` or `stopped`. Defaults to `running`
